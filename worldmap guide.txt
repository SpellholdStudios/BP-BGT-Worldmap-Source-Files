A guide to make a worldmap


1. Open BP-BGT_Worldmap_v7.0.x.xcf file with gimp (latest version: http://www.gimp.org/downloads/  )
2. In the layer menu you can change between the languages. Make the language you need visible and the other languages invisible.
   The layers are sorted alphabetical: First are all labels without translation, then the one with translation, then all labels with different positions for large and huge worldmap.
   The article 'The' at the beginning is not used for alphabetical order, this means 'The giant hills' is not sorted in 'T' but in 'G' for 'giant'
   'deutsch' means 'german' :)
   The layer order for a city is: the text for the name, background for the text, city picture
   The language order is always the same: english, german, italian, polish, spanish
   The Chinese Font is SourceHanSerifCN-Bold (latest version: https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif  )
   
3. After all changes and paintings are finished go to: Image --> Merge visible layers... 
                                                       Filters --> Artistic --> Clothify... (depth = 2)
                                                       Colors --> Curves... (open file 'worldmap color curve')
													   
4. Then Save the file as an *.bmp file in the 'bmp to mos to moz' (This have to be done for all 5 languages and the 2 sizes = 10 times)
5. Install NearInfinity (latest version: https://github.com/NearInfinityBrowser/NearInfinity  )
   Tools --> Convert --> Image to Mos
   Input file : open the worldmap *.bmp
   Output file : select the same directory
   
6. Use tileconv (latest version: https://github.com/InfinityTools/tileconv  ) to make a compressed *.moz file

You can use this code for example:
	tileconv worldmap.mos

7. Copy all the *.moz files into the right language folders in the Bp-BGT_worldmap and rename it.
