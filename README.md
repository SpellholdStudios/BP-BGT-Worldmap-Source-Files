# BP-BGT-Worldmap Source Files
 The original painting
These are the original world map files with instructions on how to create the in-game world map. You have to unzip the files with 7zip and the image file is a gimp file.

I have reworked the Gimp file and have designed many subgroups for the layer, so that you can change the language and size with only 3 mouse clicks and do not have to click as before every single layer (hundreds of layers).
